Transparency Challenge Solution
================================

The challenge requires finding which cryptohack.org subdomain uses the RSA public key 
from transparency.pem by searching Certificate Transparency logs.

Steps:
1. Parse the RSA public key from transparency.pem (optional - mainly for understanding)
2. Search Certificate Transparency logs at https://crt.sh/?q=cryptohack.org
3. Look for cryptohack.org subdomains in the results
4. Find: thetransparencyflagishere.cryptohack.org
5. Visit: https://thetransparencyflagishere.cryptohack.org

Flag: crypto{thx_redpwn_for_inspiration}

Key Learning:
- Certificate Transparency is a security measure requiring all CAs to publish issued certificates
- This prevents fraudulent certificates from being issued secretly
- Anyone can search CT logs to find certificates for any domain
- The subdomain name itself was a hint: "thetransparencyflagishere"
