List of Numbers: 588,665, 216,113,642,4,836,114,851,492,819,237

 Start with a number

Multiply by a secret number x

If the result is bigger than the secret limit p, squish it down repeatedly
subtracting p until it is smaller than p.

Each step in the list works in this way.

So the answer we are left with is p = 919 x = 209
